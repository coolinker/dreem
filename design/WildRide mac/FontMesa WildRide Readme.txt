	WildRide is a font that's based on the logo of Reese's® candy and cereal.

	WildRide comes with two fonts, the regular version that you can use alone
	and the fill version WildRide Backfill used to create an oversized outline 
	behind the WildRide regular font. Read the section on how fill fonts work below.

 
	HOW TO CONNECT DOUBLE LETTERS TOGETHER:
	
	In order to make the first letter e connect to the second e you will need to type 
	the hyphen character to create an extension for the letters e and c, you'll find 
	it on the key to the right of the number zero key also the minus key just above 
	the plus key on your number pad at the far right of your keyboard. So simply put 
	a hyphen or dash as some people call it in between the two lowercase e's and c's, 
	plus it will also connect e or c to many of the other lowercase letters.

	Note: Not all programs display the kerning or spacing of fonts the same, after 
	hours of hard work spacing a font I'll always find one or two programs that change
	the spacing I've set or not display it at all.


	HOW FILL FONTS WORK:
      

      	Fill fonts are created to fill in the hollow space within outline fonts
      	to prevent the background from showing through the font.
     	Fill fonts are usually slightly smaller than the fonts outline
      	but may also be oversized to create a border behind and around the font
      	to help separate it from a background image. Another application for fill
      	fonts would be to add decorations to the top layer of a font.
      
      	Fill fonts can only be used within applications that allow multiple
      	layers within the work area so fill fonts wouldn't work in programs
      	such as word processors like MS Word or Wordpad.
      
      	Fill fonts may not work with all applications in Windows, some
      	fonts have characters that extend outside it's em-square, although
      	the font may have been generated to allow it to display outside
      	of this boundary display problems may occur within some applications.
      	In some applications alignment problems may occur with the fill font in
      	relation to the font(s) layered above or below it, some fill fonts have
      	characters that are located to the right or left of that fonts basepoint, 
      	some applications don't recognize the left side bearing of a font set by
      	its basepoint as part of that fonts spacing and will shift the fill fonts 
      	character spacing to the left side of the characters outline and cause a 
      	misalignment to happen. The only solution around this problem is to use
      	a different program for your design work, Adobe Photoshop6 , Adobe 
      	Illustrator8, Adobe ImageStyler, and Paintshop Pro 7 all work well with 
      	fill fonts.
      
      	To use fill fonts simply type the text using the first font as the base 
      	then select the next font style and add the same text on top the base font,
      	then repeat the same with any decoration fills adding different colors
      	and textures to each font.
